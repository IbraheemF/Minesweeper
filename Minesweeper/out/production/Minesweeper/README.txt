Assumptions: The game will not be run in any size larger than a 20x20 grid. Also assumes that User will input only what is show as options while playing the game.
Bugs: Doesn't actually work as a game of Minesweeper would, but matches the HW PDF requirements. for example, in a real game revealzeros would also show the first non-zero numbers on the edges, but this implementation doesn't.
